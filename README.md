# Weather App / React

This is my first project using React.js. This weather application is using real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/) to display weather and forecast information for the user's selected city.

## Overview

It is hosted on Netlify ðŸ‘‰ https://dazzling-rosalind-867b9a.netlify.app/.
